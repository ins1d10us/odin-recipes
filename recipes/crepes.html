    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup <strong>flour</strong> </li>
        <li>2 <strong>eggs</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 cup <strong>milk</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 cup <strong>water</strong></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons <strong>butter</strong>, <em>melted</em></li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the <strong>flour</strong> and the <strong>eggs</strong>. Gradually add in the <strong>milk</strong> and <strong>water</strong>, stirring to combine. Add the <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>butter</strong>; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
